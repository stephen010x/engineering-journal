### Engineering Journal

Subject: My new Engineering Journal <br>
I will be honest, at first I was sceptical about keeping an "engineering journal". Although I quickly realized that this would be an opportunity in disguise. For there are many things I am learning or plan to learn over the coming weeks, which I will discuss. But even better is that this provides with me the perfect opportunity to complain about my least favorite languages, or bash on the frustrating decisions of my engineering professors at the SET. I even have a few plans in mind for future topics in my engineering journal.

Subject: C++ sucks, but not as much as Javascript. <br>
Listen, we all know it. At least everybody who has learned any better language knows it. C++ is just not good. But it would at least be preferrable to Javascript, as I can at least pretend it is C. <br>
You see, I am taking Bart's graphics class this semester. Javascript is already a language I am familiar with. But my lord I am quickly learning that some of the webapi's for javascript are just god awful. Especially in an untyped language such as JS. Especially WebGL. If only there was some way to make it typed\.\.\. <br>
Actually, that is exactly what I am planning to do. <br>
Bart gave us a framework to base our assignments off of. And it makes these assignments stupid easy. How am I suppose to learn how to use webgl if bart already wrote it for me? Therefore, I have decided to rewrite his entire framework in C, and then compile it to webgl to be implemented into a web enviroment. <br>
It has honestly been a great learning experience in learning the opengl api, and in compiling C to webasm. I already have most of the framework written. I just need to find or implement my own library for handling matrices so that I can set up the viewport matrices.
